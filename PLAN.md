# VitalLink Project Plan

## 1. The Core Idea (Elevator Pitch)

_What is VitalLink in one or two sentences?_

**Example Answer:** VitalLink is a transparent, AI-enhanced platform that connects organ donors with recipients, using blockchain to ensure trust and fairness in the allocation process.

## 2. Our Users (Who are we building this for?)

_List the types of users and what they need to do._

*   **As a** Public User/Potential Donor,
    **I want to** easily find information about organ donation and register myself as a donor,
    **so that I can** contribute to saving lives.

*   **As a** Medical Professional,
    **I want to** securely access patient data and see a verified list of available donors,
    **so that I can** facilitate a quick and efficient transplant process.

*   **As an** Administrator,
    **I want to** oversee the system, manage user roles, and ensure the allocation rules are transparently applied,
    **so that I can** maintain the integrity and trust of the platform.

## 3. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Version 1.0

_What is the absolute simplest version we can build first? Be ruthless about cutting features for later!_

**Features IN for the MVP:**

*   Public-facing informational page.
*   User registration (for Donors and Medical Staff).
*   User login.
*   A simple dashboard for logged-in users.
    *   Donors see their status.
    *   Medical Staff see a list of potential donors (with non-sensitive info).
*   Ability for a Donor to fill out their profile (blood type, etc.).

**Features OUT for later versions:**

*   The full-blown Mobile App.
*   The AI-powered chatbot.
*   Blockchain integration.
*   Real-time matching algorithms.
*   Advanced admin dashboards.
